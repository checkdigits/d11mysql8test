Note that the libmaria and OpenSSL dlls are included here in order to validate my test setup (which works) with other combinations which do not work.

***The included dlls are:***

**Open SSL libs**
- libeay32.dll
- libiconv-2.dll
- libintl-8.dll
- ssleay32.dll

**Maria DB redistributable DLL for testing purposes**
- libmariadb.dll
